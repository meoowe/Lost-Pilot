## Overview

In this 2D space survival game, you play as the captain of a damaged ship and its crew, who have narrowly escaped a devastating space battle. With your ship's instant transportation device malfunctioning, you find yourself stranded in a desolate region filled with abandoned space stations and wrecked ships. Your mission has shifted from combat to survival, as you must gather resources, upgrade your ship and crew, and find a way back home.

Explore the hostile environments, facing off against aliens, robots, and other dangers. Strategically improve your crew's combat abilities and your ship's capabilities, including engines, weapons, oxygen systems, and crew quarters. Hack your way through broken-down space stations, dealing with procedurally generated challenges and threats along the way.

Key Features:

- Crew management with crew member attributes, perks, and an inventory system
- Customizable ship editor, allowing you to upgrade engines, weapons, oxygen, and crew quarters
- Ship-to-ship combat, defending against pirates and unknown enemies
Exploration of space stations with hackable doors and procedurally generated content
- A wide range of enemies, from aliens to cyborgs, requiring diverse combat strategies
